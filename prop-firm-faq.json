    "question": "Is your drawdown based on balance or equity?",
    "answer": "Futures Accounts offer End of Day(EOD) Drawdown which is based on the end of day closing balance of your account. This stops once your EOD drawdown reaches the original account starting balance. For example, you start at 100k, with an $800 dollar drawdown. If you make $400 on the first day, your drawdown is now at 99,600. If you then lose 200, your drawdown stays at 99,600. If you then make 200, your drawdown is still 99,600. Once your account hits 100,800, your drawdown will lock at the 100k starting balance. So, even if you take your account to 110k, your drawdown stays at 100k. We will never offer intraday equity trailing drawdown as we believe it's predatory, and unfair to traders. We don't use them on our strategies, so we choose not to apply them in our evaluations.",
